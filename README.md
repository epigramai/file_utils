# manual_image_categorisation
This is a tool to aid the manual categorisation of images into subfolders, e.g. to create a training set for a model.
* Takes the path of a folder containing images, displays them one by one
* Pressing any letter or number moves an image into the corresponding subfolder
* Use right and left arrows to navigate forwards and backwards
* Use the up arrow to view the images that have already been categorised, and the down arrow to return to the uncategorised images
* Categorised images can be recategorised
* Pressing the backspace key uncategorises a categorised image
