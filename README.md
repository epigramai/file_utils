# manual_image_categorisation
This is a tool to aid the manual categorisation of images into subfolders, e.g. to create a training set for a model.
* Takes the path of a folder containing images, displays them one by one
* Images in the folder are considered uncategorised, images in direct subfolders are considered categorised
* Use right and left arrows to navigate forwards and backwards
* Use the up arrow to view categorised images, and the down arrow to view uncategorised images
* Pressing any letter or number moves an image into the corresponding subfolder, thus (re)categorising it
* Pressing the backspace key uncategorises a categorised image
* Pressing any other key exits the program
